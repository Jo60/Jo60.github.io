        You may be required to write an entrance exam if you are applying to highly-sought-after programs to demonstrate best qualified applicants for the programs. Transfers: VU understands that applicants who have already begun their programs at another post secondary institution may decide to transfer to the University to continue the same program or another for various reasons. However, the courses taken will have to be assessed to determine if it meets same requirement of our courses. It is the applicant’s responsibility that they have met all course requirements in their programs before transfer. The following documents will have to be submitted: Official Transcript Course Outlines Internationally assessed credentials if courses were obtained outside of the country. A World Education Service (WES) assessment report will be required. Please inform WES to send the assessed report directly to us. If language of instruction is not in English, a certified translation of the original transcript will be required. This must be signed, sealed, and mail to us otherwise they will not be accepted. If the transferred courses are granted, a Transfer Credit (TC) code will be assigned. All TCs are not included as part of calculating GPA. Non-English-Speaking Applicants: All programs at VU is taught in English language. Therefore, every applicant interested in applying to any program must demonstrate ability to understand, communicate, write, and read in English language.
